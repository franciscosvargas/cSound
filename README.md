Keep the sound of your business sound by touching what your customers want to hear. 

If at your restaurant you accept music orders to be played on the sound system, you probably get tired of attending to various requests during the day. Why not automate this process?

Connected at the Spotify **cSound** will be able to organize, filter and play what your customers want to hear quickly and intelligently.

## How it works?
The **cSound** uses the Spotify to be able to find and play any music that your customers request. 

The application will receive the music request and check if it can be played for everyone. If yes, the computer connected to the sound system will receive a new song in the current spotify playlist.

You can ban musical styles, artists that do not match your set. Besides prohibiting explicit songs.
